## Assumptions
- All data even dates are categorical
- Estimated market value scale is redone after every filter.
- User would want to submit all filters instead of grid trying to update on every keypress

## Questions

- What mapping libraries are commonly used for vue?
- What is the the common way to create your own marker?
- Is there normally a store along with vue or did I pass props upwards in the app properly?

## Future States
- Add toast functionality whenever filters are updated or submitted
- Click window to show properties of each property
